## MusicBench
MusicBench is a free-and-open-source digital audio workstation (DAW).

It is written in C, and uses the GTK user interface library, as well as the GStreamer multimedia library.

The app has several design goals, the first being ease-of-use. While many DAWs are difficult to use due to the sheer number of features, a novice should be able to use MusicBench without checking documentation.

Secondly, the app is designed according to the GNOME Foundation's Human Interface Guidelines, which means that MusicBench integrates exceptionally well with a Linux distribution running the GNOME desktop environment. However, the software is designed to work on Windows or MacOS just the same.
